	I've always wanted to make games. Here are two that managed to escape lost hard drives, a lack of version control, or forgotten credentials:

							<h3>Made in Game Maker Studio 3</h3>
							<p>This is the first game I worked on using an engine and was made during "Pirate Software Game Jam 15." 
							<br>
							<br>
							<p>I was the lead programmer.
							<br>
							<br>
							<p>We dreamed a little too big, but learned a lot in the process. What was intended to an exploration and crafting game with an "order matters" twist ended up being more on an inventory simulator with some fun dialog. We had fun and we're happy with the result.

	Born and raised in the forest, my first games were not electronic, but usually involved pine cones and mud. If the occasion, and location, called for it then the acorns would get involved. Starting with the Nintendo 64's weird (and weirdly awesome) three handle controller and now using a mouse and keyboard, I've been involved with video games for over 25 years.
	<br>
	<br>
	I've taken a circuitous route on my path on my game development journey: bits and bobs of various online courses and tutorials over the years, unrelated majors in college, and trying to find time to attend the game development club.
	<ul>
		<li>The first game I programmed my first game in a Java class, nothing to write home about - just a brick breaker clone. It was really cool using Swing to have graphics.</li>
		<li>The second game I made was for a Python class and was akin to those puzzles missing a tile that gets solved by sliding the remaining tiles. The UI was a simple text interface, but the technique of using a single array to store a 2d grid is the same method use for Bombardier.</li>
		<li>I've dabbled a few times with Unreal Engine working on a 3rd first tutorial to get familiar with the engine. I only recently built a computer powerful enough to effectively run UE.</li>
	</ul>

	I made my first [very basic] website in 7th grade (before CSS was commonplace, at least in my neck of the woods. Everyone in class was tasked with crated a website for a teacher and our "HTML only" messes are better lost to history. You can find my most recent websites here:
	<ul>
		<li><a target="_blank" href="https://nuclearpowerparty.com">nuclearpowerparty.com</a></li>
		<li><a target="_blank" href="#top">maxqbeck.com</a> (the website you're on now)</li>
	</ul>
	I'll be tackling a more dynamic website next to learn about user interaction, databases, mail servers, etc.

	I took an art class in middle school and another in high school. We also always had art supplies growing up - my dad enjoys sculpture and my sister is a professional artist (you can find her work <a target="_blank" href="https://charlibeck.com">here</a>). Most of my practice drawing comes from botany and blueprints: images that either describe how to identify something or how to build it. I'm not well-versed in people, animals, or realistic drawings.

	<article>
	A few years ago I bought 3 acres in Nevada with the goal of getting a little permaculture farm started. I've got chickens, ducks, guinea fowl, and geese - the four legged critters are waiting for a little more setup. My favorite thing (so far) is the orchard we planted that's filled with a wide variety of fruits and vegetables planted in between.

	This is the first building we built, from the ground up. At least half of the material used was recycled and anything that wasn't reused in this project has been reused elsewhere on the farm. Much was learned in the process: framing, waterproofing, drywall, and electrical. Since this shed's construction, we've built a chicken coop and a greenhouse.

	Our chickens were the first critters to join the farm. At one point we had 90 and were getting 3.5 dozen eggs a day. We've since scaled back and found new homes for our feathered friends. We have a much more manageable flock of 20 chickens. We've also added some ducks, geese, and guinea fowl. Guinea fowl are very loud and make great alarm clocks.

			<h2>Wood Working</h2>
			<p>Most of my wood working projects happen with my dad and all of them happen because of him. I remember the first project we worked on was making boxes. We used old dog leashes and collars for the handles and latches. I was too young to work with the tools, but my siblings and I all painted them ourselves. I still have my (poorly) painted box.</p>

			<h2>Metal Working</h2>
			<p>I enjoy both additive and subtractive manufacturing. Until college, I had done smaller scale projects with my dad, mostly with hand tools. In college I worked for the Cal Poly College of Architecture and Environmental Design, in the digital fabrication shop. There I learned about CNC machines: routers, laser cutters, and water jets. I also spent some time in the wood and metals shops learning how to weld, cast metal, and generally help students take their designs from concept to physical object.</p>
			<p>I learned about precision manufacturing in the Air Force as a Metals Technologist where I made and repaired air craft parts.</p>

			<h2>Calligraphy</h2>
			<p>I took up letter writing in high school when my friends started working as summer camp. In an effort to write more interesting letters, I also took up calligraphy - which is a little challenging because I'm left handed.</p>

			<h2>Rock Climbing</h2>
			<p>I've always played on boulders: I grew up in the forest and it's just what there was to do. Both my sisters are rock climbers and I took up the sport in college. I didn't start bouldering until a climbing gym opened a few blocks from work. Then I was climbing 4 hours a day, 5 days a week.</p>

			<h2>Electronics</h2>
			<p>Since I was old enough to hold tools, I've been taking things apart: VCRs, remote controls, TVs, an Easy Bake Oven<sup>&reg;</sup>, ...you get the idea. As soon as no one wanted it anymore, I was busy voiding the warranty. Some things were even reassembled. In college, I started playing with Raspberry Pis and Arduino which is when I started learning about Linux, python, C++, and microcontroller controlled electronics. Before then, most of my projects were from science kits.

			<h2>Video Game</h2>
			<p>My first system was a Nintendo 64 that I still have (and play) 26 years later. I've also inherited the family's Game Boys which find occasional to throw Tetris my way. I've played a little bit of everything and had a blast doing it. Most recently I play games with my friends if they're available. Otherwise I'll play WoW or test around on the Ashes of Creation alpha.

			<h2>Knots</h2>
			<p>Whether it's from the amount of times I've moved, earning my Eagle Scout, or something else - I really enjoy knots. I have a copy of the <u>Ashley Book of Knots</u>. Some cool decorative knots: monkey's fist, turk's head, 5 point star knot. Accompanying fun fact: decorative knots also have practical purposes - monkey's fists and star knots add weight to a line; turk's heads can be applied to prevent fraying. Two very useful knots: the bowline and n-half hitches (where n >= 2).
